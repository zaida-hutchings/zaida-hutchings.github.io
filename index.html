              Hello, I’m Zaida! I am a senior at the University of Georgia! I’m excited to work with you on your next project.

             <h3>About Me</h3> 
              <p>
              I am a double major in Japanese and Entertainment and Media Studies. I am set to graduate in the Fall of 2026! I have an avid interest in writing, video game design, and languages. I have studied abroad in Nagasaki, Japan for six months.  I have also researched Japanese media as an undergraduate CURO researcher.  
              My main goal is to work as a video game designer! I love being able to bring the best out of my team mates. Coming up with fun new mechanics and dynamic storylines is an added bonus! I’d also like to continue traveling and meeting new people!

              If the world was ending, what would your last words be? Who would you say it to? Leave a Message is a 3d narrative game where you play as the world's last messenger. This was created for the UGA Game Builder's Club for the Fall of 2024 as a semester-long project. I was the team lead for the project. I pitched the game, managed ten people, designed and wrote the storyline, and made a theme song.

              Trapped inside a nightmarish land, play solo or with up to four friends to stealthly escape the Ink Monster before it consumes you. Mirror Mirror is a year-long on going project led by Zaida Hutchings. She pitched the game, and is managing her team (currently with nine members), doing the 3d Art and animation for the player characters, and fully designing the game.

This was created for the UGA Game Builder's Club for the Spring of 2025 as a semester-long project. I was primarily an artist for the game, and I programed one of the mini-games. I did the NPC sprites and animations. I also helped with environmental art.

            <p>
              In Making a List: Checking it Twice, it has been a bad day at work for Santa. Nutcrackers and Gingerbread men are rioting and have taken the elves hostage! Time to get down and dirty, and let them know who's been naughty and who's been nice. 

This was a 48-hour game jam with several universities across Georgia. Making A List ranked 2nd best overall. I worked with three other students. I helped with music, enemy design and animation, and environmental and UI art.
