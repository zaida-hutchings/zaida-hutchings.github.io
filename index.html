              Hello, I’m Zaida! I am a senior at the University of Georgia! I’m excited to work with you on your next project.

             <h2>About Me</h2> 
              <p>
              I am a double major in Japanese and Entertainment and Media Studies. I am set to graduate in the Fall of 2026! I have an avid interest in writing, video game design, and languages. I have studied abroad in Nagasaki, Japan for six months.  I have also researched Japanese media as an undergraduate CURO researcher.  
              My main goal is to work as a video game designer! I love being able to bring the best out of my team mates. Coming up with fun new mechanics and dynamic storylines is an added bonus! I’d also like to continue traveling and meeting new people!
